# Introduction

SwipeListView was born out of the need to add swipe gestures to ListView on Android for 
@ [47 Degrees][4] Clients. Contributions and constructive feedback are welcome.

# Download

## Maven Dependency

SwipeListView may be automatically imported into your project if you already use [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). 
Just declare android-swipelistview as a maven dependency.
If you wish to always use the latest unstable snapshots, add the Sonatype repository where the SwipeListView 
snapshot artifacts are being deployed.
SwipeListView official releases will be made available at Maven Central.

```xml
<repository>
    <id>sonatype</id>
    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/</url>
    <releases>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
        <updatePolicy>daily</updatePolicy>
        <checksumPolicy>fail</checksumPolicy>
    </releases>
    <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
        <updatePolicy>always</updatePolicy>
        <checksumPolicy>ignore</checksumPolicy>
    </snapshots>
</repository>

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fortysevendeg.android</groupId>
    <artifactId>swipelistview</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <type>apklib</type>
</dependency>
```
## APKLib and others

You can get the releases, snapshots and other forms in which SwipeListView is distributed from the Maven sonatype Repository here
[Downloads][5].

## Dependencies

SwipeListView depends on the following libraries.

- com.nineoldandroids 

SwipeListView expects that you include one of the Google Android [compatibility libraries][3] in order to use Loaders in versions that do not support them natively.
Depending on your requirements you may choose to include one of the following...

- com.google.android :
    - support-v4 (Available in Maven Central)

# Using the standalone SwipeListView JAR

If you manually include the single SwipeListView jar [swipelistview-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar][5] in your libs/ folder you would also have to add the following dependencies:

- [nineoldandroids-2.4.0.jar][8]
- android-support-v4

You'd have to provide also the [attrs.xml][9] inside your directory "res/values" so the attributes are properly picked up by the runtime.

We do discourage people from manually adding the jars and recomend following the maven or apklib aproach to include SwipeListView library in your own project.

# Demo

You can see a demo SwipeListView in action at [android-swipelistview-sample][2] or install it from [Google Play][1]


# XML Usage

If you decide to use SwipeListView as a view, you can define it in your xml layout like this:

```xml
    <com.fortysevendeg.android.swipelistview.SwipeListView
            xmlns:swipe="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
            android:id="@+id/example_lv_list"
            android:listSelector="#00000000"
            android:layout_width="fill_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            swipe:swipeFrontView="@+id/front"
            swipe:swipeBackView="@+id/back"
            swipe:swipeActionLeft="[reveal | dismiss]"
            swipe:swipeActionRight="[reveal | dismiss]"
            swipe:swipeMode="[none | both | right | left]"
            swipe:swipeCloseAllItemsWhenMoveList="[true | false]"
            swipe:swipeOpenOnLongPress="[true | false]"
            swipe:swipeAnimationTime="[miliseconds]"
            swipe:swipeOffsetLeft="[dimension]"
            swipe:swipeOffsetRight="[dimension]"
            />
